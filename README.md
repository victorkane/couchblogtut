Up-to-date, executable code for two great tutorials on rolling a blog with express, Node.js and a noSQL database.

The first, [Blog rolling with mongoDB, express and Node.js](http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb), takes you "through the steps required to get a fully-functional (albeit feature-light) persistent blogging system running on top of node. It was first published on February 18, 2010 by Ciaran Jessup and last updated May 14, 2010.

The second, [Blog rolling with CouchDB, Express and Node.js](http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2011/02/07/blog-rolling-with-couchdb-express-and-node-js), was published on February 7, 2011 by Ian Wootten, and was commented on just this last April.

This pedagogical repo brings it up to date (as of June 22, 2011), makes a MongoDB branch basing the persistence on MongoDB; and a CouchDB branch (ultimately merged into Master) after the more recent article.

Further comments and background can be found on [my blogpost covering this repo](http://awebfactory.com.ar/node/475).
