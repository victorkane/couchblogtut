This branch contains up-to-date, executable code for [Blog rolling with mongoDB, express and Node.js](http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb), which takes you "through the steps required to get a fully-functional (albeit feature-light) persistent blogging system running on top of node. It was first published on February 18, 2010 by Ciaran Jessup and last updated May 14, 2010.

This pedagogical repo has a MongoDB branch (this one) basing the persistence on MongoDB; and a CouchDB branch (ultimately merged into Master) after the more recent article, [Blog rolling with CouchDB, Express and Node.js](http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2011/02/07/blog-rolling-with-couchdb-express-and-node-js), which was published on February 7, 2011 by Ian Wootten, and was commented on just this last April.
